This is a first test port of the original interactive book into the Jupyter Book 2 framework

This repository contains source files for a book that illustrates Riemann
solutions and approximate Riemann solvers in Jupyter notebooks.  The print version
of the book is [available from SIAM](https://my.siam.org/Store/Product/viewproduct/?ProductId=31634540),
and also as an [ebook](https://epubs.siam.org/doi/book/10.1137/1.9781611976212).  You can view a pdf 
version of the [contents, preface, and index](https://archive.siam.org/books/fa16/fa16fmbm.pdf).
